            <p class="poems_title">Professor Senarath Paranavithana started work on
                Sigiriya graffiti from 1928 and finally has made an
                incalculable contribution to Sri Lanka Archeology by
                deciphering 685 Sigiriya graffiti from the mirror wall
                and were published in two monumental volumes tittled
                Sigiri Graffiti in 1956.Paranavithana’s publication
                contains majority of the complete poems which are of
                high poetic quality.</p><br><br>
            <p class="poems_title">Benil Priyanka has done a strenuous detail study
                and published another 800 graffiti which are shorter,
                incomplete or only the name of visitor in 2010 which
                include 40 or more writings from Polonnaruwa and
                Dambadeniya period.
                Visitors have written down their poetic appreciation of
                the beauty of the ladies depicted in the paintings while
                recording more than 1000 Sinhala words used at that
                time ,about 250 names of the Authors, large number
                of place names, names of royalty, ranks and titles of
                authors, chronological development of Sinhala script
                from 6th to 13th centaury and many other information
                about Sinhala grammar, intellectual quality of the
                visitor, their literal creativity and many more things
                of the society who visited Sigiriya.
                All visitors to Sigiriya may not have written poems
                NTSL NDS-Page 24 of 27
                but what is written has mirrored the quality of the
                society. I will present ten of these poems.

                        I am Budal who wrote this
                        I came with a crowd and saw Sihigiri
                        I did not write a song as many people have
                        written them.

                        She stirs to break the stillness and ask if we
                        could bear to know her tragic story.

                        Having climbed (Sigiri) I am delighted with
                        the site created by the natural surroundings of
                        Sri Lanka. The words she spoke exited me.

                        I am Bati, who having ascended Sihigiri and
                        recalled (things) to memory. I’m composing
                        a song.
                        There is no song for those (the ladies) who
                        captivate the eyes and mind of people.

                        Ah ! the golden coloured one on the mountain
                        side, who entices ones eye and mind and whose
                        breasts are delightful to look at directed my
                        mind to the intoxicated swans.

                        Hail! I am vira-vidura bato I wrote this
                        The gentle breeze blew- the breeze which
                        is wet with cool dew drops- taking with it
                        fragrant perfume, in the spring sun shine, the
                        jasmine and water lily, being adorned with
                        flowers, shone all over. Leaving it all side,
                        my mind was agitated on seeing these golden
                        colured ones and , being shot at whilst going
                        by their side long glances.
                        I became prostrate on the slope of this rock
                        Having seen to my heart’s content, the five
                        hundred Damsels on the surface of the rock,
                        and having well remembered one of them.
                        Heaven itself does not take my mind.

                        Hail! the song of vajara, Having seen, on the
                        mountain side, a long eyed golden coloured
                        one who for sake of coolness has put on sweet
                        scented flowers enveloping her breast cloth,
                        having seen her my mind has been troubled.

                        I am agboy. I wrote this like a vatakola flower.
                        Entangled in a blue katarola flower, the golden
                        coloured one who stood together with the lily
                        coloured one will be remembered at the advent
                        of the evening.

                    <li>
                        Wet with cool dew drops fragrant with perfume from the
                        flowers came the gentle breeze jasmine and
                        water lily dance in the spring sunshine side-long
                        glances of the golden-hued ladies stab into my
                        thoughts heaven itself cannot take my mind as
                        it has been captivated by one lass among the five
                        hundred I have seen here.
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>
                        The five hundred damsels arrest the progress of him who is
                        going to heaven. With their gentle smile
                        and the fluttering of their eye-lids, the damsels stood here,
                        enslaved me who had come to the summit
                        of the cliff.
