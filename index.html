          <h3>Sigiri Graffiti</h3>
          <p>After the fall of sigiri Kingdom the people visited the city till about tenth century A.D The visitors
            climbed the rock and saw the place of King Kassapa. They
            saw the paintings and the ruins of the citadel. The visitors inscribe their feelings on the great wall.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Wet with cool dew drops fragrant with perfume from the flowers came the gentle breeze jasmine and water
              lily dance in the spring sunshine side-long glances of the golden-hued ladies stab into my thoughts
              heaven itself cannot take my mind as it has been captivated by one lass among the five hundred I have
              seen here.</li>
            <li>There is no song for those (the ladies) who captivate the eyes and mind of people</li>
            <li>The five hundred damsels arrest the progress of him who is going to heaven.
              With their gentle smile and the fluttering of their eye-lids, the damsels stood here,
              enslaved me who had come to the summit of the cliff...</li>

          <h3>Paintings</h3>
          <p>The Paintings are in the caves on the Western face of the rock. They are about 12 meters above the floor
            of
            the gallery. The caves are small and natural. Present day
            the archeological department has widened the caves with concrete. There is a spiral staircase to reach the
            paintings, from the gallery. A wire
            net is fixed to prevent birds and other insect getting into the caves. It is believes that there had been
            painting right around the rock. There are patches of
            plaster remaining below the drip-ledge. One of the graffiti says that there had been 550 paintings. The
            visitor can see the continuation of the plaster from the caves.The frescoes consist of 21 figures of
            females rising from clouds. In figures, only the waist upwards being painted.
            in the cave number one, there are 17 such female portraits. The female figures are life-size These were
            painted upon a wet plaster, with, colors mixed with water.
