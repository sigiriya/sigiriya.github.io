                According to chronicles King Dhatusena had two sons, Kassapa and Moggallana, and a daughter. He gave
                her in
                marriage to his nephew, who was the Commander-in-chief.
                One day for no reason, she was on her thighs by her husband. She complained about the incident to the
                king. The
                king saw the bloodstained dress of his daughter. He
                was provoked over this and ordered Senpathi's (Commander-in-chief) mother, his own sister to be burnt
                naked.
                Thereby the Senapathi became angry with the king. To take
                revenge from him he joined Prince Kassapa and conspired against the king. Senapathi inspired in him a
                great
                love for the kingship.
                Gradually they won the goodwill of the nobles, royalties, and ministers. Prince Kassapa and captured
                power and
                took king Dhatusena as a prisoner, on the eighteenth year
                after his coronation. He killed those who favored his father. His brother, Prince Moggallana got angry
                over
                the matter and fled to South India. Consequently, Prince Kassapa
                became the king of Lanka.
                <br>
                <br>
                King Dhatusena who was a prisoner thought of his young days as a priest, and the difficulties that his
                uncle Mahanama Thero had to undergo to save him from Tamils. He thought of the wars that he fought
                against them and recalled the difficulties that he experienced to save the country, nation and
                Buddhism. The king thought of the downfall of his kingdom, separation of his son, daughter, queen and
                royal family, and life in a prison. To give him more mental agony, Senapathi told king Kassapa, that
                his father was hiding treasure for Prince Moggallana. Then king Kassapa sent messengers to his father
                inquiring about the place where he had hidden the treasure. King Dhatusena was silent. King Kassapa
                sent reminders repeatedly to know the place. Finally, king Dhatusena realized that his son was trying
                to kill him, and before that he thought of visiting his uncle Mahanama Thero, Kalawewaa and kalavapi
                vihara. Then he told a messenger to take him to Kalavapi Vihara. When Kassapa received the news, he
                orderd the Senpathi to take king Dhatusena to Kalavapi vihara by a
                chariot. On the way, the chariot driver gave the king some sweet prepared out of rice, which the king
                thanked him and ate. Then as a reward he gave a letter to the chariot driver to be given to Prince
                Moggallana, asking him to appoint the chariot driver as his chamber guard.

                <br>

                When Mahanama Thero heard about the arrival of king Dhatusena, he kept a portion of rive, been soup and
                flesh of birds which he received as alms. Mahanama Thero remembering the past, sat
                on his seat awaiting the arrival of the king. The king came and worshiped Mahanama Thero and sat by his
                side. Thero entertained the king kindly. He encouraged him to obey the law. After the discussion he
                went to the bund of the Kalawewa and jumped into the reservoir and he bathed and drank water. He got on
                to the bund and showed the glittering waters of Kalavapi as his treasure. The
                guards took king Dhatusena to king Kassapa. Then the Senpathi told king, that king Dhatusena is still
                preserving the treasure for his son Prince Moggallana. As a consequence, king Kassapa ordered the
                ministers to kill his father. The Senapathi was rejoiced to see the end of his enemy. To give him more
                and more mental agony, the Senapathi walked up and down before the king adorned in all his ornaments.
                Then the king spoke to Senapathi and told him that he loved his son Prince Moggalana and Senapathi
                alike. Then the Senapathi shook his head and ordered the guards to undress the king, tie his hands back
                with chains and to place against a wall and plaster him.
                <br>
                <br>

                King Kassapa sent his men to kill his brother Prince Moggallana. As he was unable to achieve this aim,
                he left Anuradhapura kingdom to Sigiriya. He built a stronghold where he could defend him self against
                his brother. He built his place on the summit of the rock, and strengthened the security of the city
                with two walls and two moats, and constructed a flight of steps to the summit from the base of the
                rock. The entrance was in the form of the lionâ€™s mouth. Thus the rock was named as Sihagiri. King
                Kassapa lived with luxury and pleasure as the God Alake.

                <br>

                The king made gardens around the city and planted mango groves all over the country. He repaired the
                ancient Issurumuni Vihara and offered the vihara to the Mahavihara at Anuradhapura. Also he built a
                vihara at Sigiriya and offered the bhikkus at Abayagiri Vihara at Anuradhapura. They made the vihara as
                the centre of Dhammaruchi. One day a lady gave the king a dish of boiled rice prepared with milk of
                king coconut and ghee. In addition, she gave him a soup. The king ate the dish of rice, which was so
                tasty, and offered the same preparation to bhikkus. He observed the Eight Noble Truths. The king made
                arrangement to write books on the Dhamma, and built monasteries and ordered the people to give alms to
                bhikkus. In the eighteenth year after his coronation his brother Prince Moggallana landed in Lanka,
                with the information of a Nigantha. He landed with a well organized army from South India, and built
                his fortress at Dhambakolapatuna. When king Kassapa heard this news, he declared war against his
                brother. The mahavamsa says that the two armies met as clashing of seas. King Kassapa marched and
                fought as a lion. At the beginning king Kassapa was wining the war, but after he was surrounded by the
                enemy from several directions. When the army was marching towards the king, suddenly the king met a
                stretch of swamp in front and he turned his elephant to seek another direction. His army saw this and
                thought that the king was turning back. Then the army also turned back giving up the war. The king saw
                that his army was in disorder and also heard the shouting of enemy that they have got the victory. King
                Kassapa as a brave king cut his neck with his sword. he threw his head away with his sword. The
                mahavansa says that he threw his head away with his left hand and put the sword int his sheath.
                <br>
                <br>
                When king Kassapa died Prince Moggallana was crowned as the king of Lanka. As a respect to the bravery
                of his brother he held the funeral with royal patronage and took all the wealth to Anuradhapura , to
                establish himself as the king. He converted the palace of Kassapa to a Buddhist monastery and offered
                to Mahanama Thero, About a century later the mahavansa refers to Sigiri in 614-619 A.D. It says that
                king Moggalana 3 beheaded the king Sangathissa 2, his son and one of his ministers at the summit of
                Sigiri. After this incident Sigiri was never mentioned in mahavansa.
