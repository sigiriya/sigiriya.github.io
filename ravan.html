                <h1 class="gallery_h1">Ravan Story</h1>

                <p class="ravan_p">Ravana is the mythical multi-headed demon-king of Lanka in Hindu mythology.
                    With ten heads and twenty arms, Ravana could
                    change into any form he wished. Representing the very
                    essence of evil, he famously fought and ultimately lost a series of epic
                    battles against the hero Rama, seventh avatar of Vishnu.</p><br>
                <p class="ravan_p">Ravana was born to great sage Vishrava (or Vesamuni), and his wife, the daitya princess Kaikeshi.
                    People
                    of Bisrakh village in Uttar Pradesh claim that Bisrakh was named after Vishrava, and that Ravana was
                    born there. But according to Hela historical sources and folklore, Ravana was born in Lanka, where
                    he
                    later became king.</p><br>
                    <p class="ravan_p">
                    Ravana's grandfather on his father's side, the sage Pulastya, was one of the ten Prajapatis or
                    mind-born sons of Brahma and one of the Saptarishi (Seven Great Sages Rishi) in the first Manvantara
                    (age of Manu). His grandfather on his mother's side, Sumali (or Sumalaya), king of the Raksasas, was
                    the
                    son of Sukesha. Sukesha's parents were King Vidyutkesa, who had married Salakantankata (daughter of
                    Sandhya), who had abandoned Sukesha, but by the grace of Shiva he survived. Sumali had wished her to
                    marry the most powerful being in the mortal world, so as to produce an exceptional heir. He rejected
                    the
                    kings of the world, as they were less powerful than him. Kaikesi searched among the sages and
                    finally
                    chose Vishrava, the father of Kubera. Ravana and his siblings were born to the couple. They
                    completed
                    their education from their father, with Ravana being a great scholar of the Vedas. The brothers
                    performed penances on Mt Gokarna for 11,000 years and won boons from Brahma. Ravana was blessed with
                    a
                    boon that would make him invincible to the creation of Brahma, except for humans. He also received
                    weapons, chariot as well as the ability to shapeshift from Brahma. Ravana later usurped Lanka from
                    his
                    half-brother Kubera("also known as Kuvera") and became the King of Lanka. He appointed Shukracharya as his priest and learnt
                    the
                    Arthashastra (Science of Politics) from him. Rama once addressed Ravana as a "Maha Brahman" ("Great
                    Brahman" in the context of his education).

                    After worshiping Shiva on the banks of the Narmada, in the more central Yadu region, Ravana was
                    captured
                    and held under the control of king Kartavirya Arjuna, one of the greatest Yadu kings. It is clear
                    from
                    the references in the Ramayana that Ravana was no commoner among the Humans or Asuras, but a great
                    chanter of the Sama Veda.</p>
                <h2 class="ravan_h2">Family</h2>
                <p class="ravan_p">
                    Ravana's family are hardly mentioned outside the Ramayana, which is viewed by some as being only the
                    point of view of Rama devotees. According to that:
                    <ul class="ravan_ul">
                        <li>Ravana's grandfather was Malyavan, who was against the war with Rama and Lakshmana.</li>
                        <li>Ravana's parents were Vishrava (son of Pulastya) and Pushpothkata (daughter of Sumali and
                            Thataka).
                            Kaikesi had two brothers, Maricha and Subahu, which would effectively make them Ravana's
                            uncles.</li>
                        <li>Ravana had six brothers and two sisters:</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Kuberan("also known as Kuvera") – the King of North direction and the Guardian of Heavenly Wealth. He was an
                                older
                                half-brother of Ravana: they were born to the same father by different mothers.</li>
                            <li> Vibhishana – A follower of Rama and one of the most important characters in the
                                Ramayana. As a
                                minister and brother of Ravana, he spoke the truth without fear and advised Ravana to
                                return the
                                kidnapped Sita and uphold Dharma. Ravana not only rejected this sane advice, but also
                                banished him
                                from his kingdom. Vibhishana sought protection from Rama, which was granted without
                                hesitation.</li>
                            <li> Kumbhakarna – One of the most jovial demons in Hindu history. When offered a boon by
                                Brahma, he was
                                tricked into asking for eternal sleep. A horrified Ravana, out of brotherly love,
                                persuaded Brahma
                                to amend the boon. Brahma mitigated the power of the boon by making Kumbhakarna sleep
                                for six months
                                and being awake for the rest six months of a year (in some versions, he is awake for one
                                day out of
                                the year). During the war with Rama, Kumbhakarna was untimely awakened from his sleep.
                                He tried to
                                persuade Ravana to open negotiations with Rama and return Sita to him. But he too failed
                                to mend the
                                ways of Ravana. However, bound by a brother's duty, he fought on the side of Ravana and
                                was killed
                                in the battlefield. Before dying he met Vibhishana and blessed him for following the
                                path of
                                righteousness.</li>
                            <li> Kharan – King of Janasthan.[15] He protected the northern kingdom of Lanka in the
                                mainland and his
                                kingdom bordered with the Kosala Kingdom, the kingdom of Rama. He was well known for his
                                superior
                                skills in warfare. He was killed by Rama.</li>
                            <li> Dushana – Viceroy of Janasthan.</li>
                            <li> Ahiravan – King of the Underworld ruled by the rakshasas by Ravana and the demon king
                                Maya.</li>
                            <li> Kumbhini – Older sister of Ravana and the wife of the demon Madhu, King of Mathura, she
                                was the
                                mother of Lavanasura. She was renowned for her beauty and later retired to the sea for
                                penance.</li>
                            <li> Shurpanakha – The sister of Ravana. She was the ultimate root of the kidnapping of
                                Sita. She was the
                                one who instigated her brothers to wage a war against Rama.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li> Ravana was married to Mandodari, the daughter of the celestial architect Maya,
                            Dhanyamalini, and a
                            third wife. He had seven sons from his three wives:</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Meghnaad (also known as Indrajit because he defeated Indra), the most powerful son</li>
                            <li> Atikaya</li>
                            <li>Akshayakumara</li>
                            <li>Narantaka</li>
                            <li>Devantaka</li>
                            <li>Trishira</li>
                            <li>Prahastha</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2 class="ravan_h2">Ravana and Rama Battle</h2>
                <p class="ravan_p">The Ramayana is really concerned with the story of the semi-divine Lord Rama, believed by many Hindus
                    to be based on a historical figure. He is perhaps the most virtuous figure in all of Hindu
                    mythology. His adventures illustrate above all the importance and rewards of fulfilling one’s pious
                    duty or dharma, and he had been born for one specific task - to answer the call of the gods and kill
                    the fearsome multi-headed demon Ravana, terror of the earth. <br> <br>

                    Rama’s troubles began when he was exiled from his father’s kingdom, a victim of a conspiracy
                    concocted by his mother's jealous hunchback slave, Manthara. On top of that, his brother Bharata was
                    made heir in Rama’s place. For 14 years Rama had to wander the earth, visit sages, and wait to
                    fulfil his destiny. <br> <br>

                    Rama, his wife Sita, and great friend Laksmana one day eventually ended up at Pancavati along the
                    river Godavari, an area plagued by demons. One in particular, Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, fell
                    in love with Rama, and when her advances were resisted, she attacked Sita in revenge. Laksmana was
                    the first to react and cut off the ears and nose of Surpanakha. Not best pleased with this
                    treatment, the enraged demoness gathered an army of demons to attack the trio. In an epic battle
                    Rama defeated them all; however, Surpanakha was not finished with the matter, and she persuaded
                    Ravana that Sita was a girl worth fighting for. Accordingly, the demon king sought out Rama’s home,
                    and while Rama was distracted in the hunt for a deer (who was actually Ravana’s magician Maricha in
                    disguise), abducted Sita, taking her back to Lanka in his aerial chariot to be kept captive in the
                    beautiful Ashoka garden of his palace. <br> <br>
                    Rama followed in hot pursuit. First he had to fight the monster Kabandha and assist the monkey king
                    Sugriva, but as a reward for the latter, he gained the invaluable help of Sugriva’s general Hanuman
                    and his army. Hanuman was also the son of the wind and able to leap huge distances, taking any form
                    he wished. It was he who magically transported Rama and his force to Lanka, crossing the rock bridge
                    built by the skilled general Nala, which became known as Rama’s Bridge. <br><br>

                    A series of titanic battles between Rama’s forces and the demons followed, sometimes Ravana got the
                    upper hand, at other times Rama. In one fight, Rama managed to cut off one of Ravana’s heads with an
                    arrow but another immediately grew to replace it. Finally, another of Rama’s arrows was a direct hit
                    on Ravana’s chest. The arrow went straight through the demon, travelled over the seas and came
                    straight back into Rama’s quiver. Ravana was dead and the world rid of a terrible lawless force.
                    Having been the son of a brahmana (priest), Ravana was given a proper funeral and his body burnt
                    according to correct ritual. Lanka had, meanwhile, fallen to Rama’s army, and the hero headed back
                    home to reclaim his throne and begin a golden era of government. <br><br>

                </p>
                <h2 class="ravan_h2">Sigiriya as Ravana’s palace site</h2>
                <p class="ravan_p">Apart from the history books, many a noted historians believe Sigiriya to have a connect with
                    Ramayana’s Ravana. It is believed that the plateau top was the site of Ravana’s majestic palace,
                    made of solid gold and crafted by Kubera, the God of Wealth, around 50 centuries ago. One look at
                    the site, and you would know how big an architectural feat this place must have been. With around
                    1000 stairs to the top, it used to have a lift for Ravana and his visitors to get to the top.
                    Imagine this place with a lift that worked some 50 centuries ago! </p> <br><br>
                <p class="ravan_p">If you look closely towards the bottom of this rock plateau, you will find a number of caves. As
                    believed, one of these caves is where Ravana imprisoned Sita, after abducting her. This story can
                    very well be true for the cave walls have (still) brightly-coloured paintings, depicting scenes from
                    the age of Ramayana. Other than that, you will spot a number of women portraits, believed to be
                    portraits of the many wives of Ravana.</p><br><br><br>
